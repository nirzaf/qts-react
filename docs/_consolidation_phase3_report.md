## Archival
All source documents moved to `docs/_archived_sources/` for reference. No deletions performed in this phase.

## Next Steps
- Review synthesized guides for accuracy; request adjustments if needed.
- On approval, proceed to remove `_archived_sources` as part of final cleanup (per Phase 3 protocol).
