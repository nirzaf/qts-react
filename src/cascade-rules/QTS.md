# creating a rolling text animation effect:
## The animation would need several key components to create the illusion of text rolling like a ball:

# Initial Position:
## Text starts completely off-screen on the left side
## You'll want to set overflow to hidden on the container to control the entry

# Rolling Motion:
## The key to creating a realistic rolling ball effect is combining two animations:
### A rotation animation that makes the text spin as if it's rolling
The rotation speed should match the horizontal movement speed to make it look natural
### For example, if the text moves 100px horizontally, it should complete one full 360Â° rotation
### This creates the illusion that the text is actually rolling on a surface

# Transform Origin:
## Set the transform-origin to the bottom of the text
### This makes the text rotate around its base, similar to how a ball rolls on the ground
### Without this, the text would spin around its center, which wouldn't look like rolling

# Motion Physics:
### Consider adding slight easing to make it more natural
### Start with a bit of acceleration and end with deceleration
### You might want to add a tiny vertical bounce at the end to simulate the ball settling

# Text Handling:
### You could either animate the text as a whole unit
### Or for more complexity, animate each letter separately with a slight delay
### If animating letters separately, each would need to roll in sequence

# The trickiest part is synchronizing the horizontal movement with the rotation speed to make it look physically accurate. The text should rotate at a speed that matches what you'd expect from a real rolling object - too fast or too slow will break the illusion.
### Think of it like a cylinder rolling on a surface - the circumference of the cylinder determines how far it moves with each complete rotation. You'll want to match this natural physics in your animation to make it look convincing.
