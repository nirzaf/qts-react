# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing React + Vite application (Quadrate Tech Solutions website) to Next.js while maintaining complete visual and functional parity. The migration aims to leverage Next.js benefits including improved SEO, server-side rendering, better performance, and enhanced developer experience without altering any UI elements, animations, or user-facing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the migrated Next.js application to look and function identically to the current React + Vite version, so that my user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the visual appearance SHALL be identical to the current implementation
2. WHEN a user interacts with animations THEN all hero animations, service cards, and transitions SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the routing behavior SHALL maintain the same URL structure and navigation patterns
4. WHEN a user accesses the blog THEN all markdown rendering and syntax highlighting SHALL function identically
5. WHEN a user uses the interview assessment THEN all interactive features SHALL work without changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing components and functionality to be preserved during migration, so that no features are lost or broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN all React components SHALL be preserved with identical functionality
2. WHEN migrating animations THEN Framer Motion animations SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN migrating forms THEN all contact forms and interview assessment forms SHALL function identically
4. WHEN migrating API integrations THEN Supabase integration SHALL work without modifications
5. WHEN migrating styling THEN Tailwind CSS classes and custom styles SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN migrating TypeScript code THEN all type definitions and interfaces SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the SEO functionality to be enhanced through Next.js features, so that search engine optimization is improved while maintaining existing SEO elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are rendered THEN Next.js SSR/SSG SHALL be implemented for better SEO
2. WHEN search engines crawl the site THEN all existing meta tags, structured data, and sitemaps SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN pages load THEN the existing SEO scripts (sitemap generation, RSS feeds) SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN implementing Next.js SEO THEN the existing react-helmet-async functionality SHALL be replaced with Next.js Head component
5. WHEN generating static content THEN blog posts and static pages SHALL be pre-rendered for optimal performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and deployment process to be updated for Next.js, so that the application can be built and deployed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN Next.js build process SHALL replace Vite build
2. WHEN running development server THEN Next.js dev server SHALL provide the same development experience
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN the deployment configuration SHALL be updated for Next.js compatibility
4. WHEN running scripts THEN all existing automation scripts SHALL continue to function
5. WHEN linting code THEN ESLint configuration SHALL be updated for Next.js best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow Next.js conventions, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows framework best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the project SHALL use Next.js App Router structure
2. WHEN creating pages THEN the existing page components SHALL be converted to Next.js page components
3. WHEN handling routing THEN client-side routing SHALL be replaced with Next.js routing
4. WHEN managing assets THEN the public folder structure SHALL be adapted for Next.js
5. WHEN configuring the application THEN Next.js configuration SHALL replace Vite configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies and integrations to work seamlessly with Next.js, so that no functionality is lost during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Supabase THEN the integration SHALL work identically in Next.js environment
2. WHEN using Framer Motion THEN all animations SHALL be compatible with Next.js SSR
3. WHEN using Tailwind CSS THEN the styling system SHALL be properly configured for Next.js
4. WHEN using React components THEN all existing components SHALL be compatible with Next.js
5. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the type system SHALL work seamlessly with Next.js

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a site visitor, I want the application performance to be maintained or improved, so that page load times and user experience remain optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the performance SHALL be equal to or better than the current implementation
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN Next.js Image optimization SHALL be implemented where appropriate
3. WHEN JavaScript loads THEN code splitting and optimization SHALL be maintained or improved
4. WHEN styles are applied THEN CSS optimization SHALL be maintained through Next.js
5. WHEN analytics run THEN Vercel Analytics integration SHALL continue to function properly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure migration success, so that I can verify all functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing pages THEN all routes SHALL load correctly and display proper content
2. WHEN testing components THEN all interactive elements SHALL function as expected
3. WHEN testing forms THEN all form submissions SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN testing animations THEN all Framer Motion animations SHALL render properly
5. WHEN testing builds THEN the production build SHALL complete successfully without errors
6. WHEN testing deployment THEN the application SHALL deploy and run correctly in production environment
